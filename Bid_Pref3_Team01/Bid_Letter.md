## Why Team 01 choose this project as third preference? 

Personnel recording system has a significant role in collect person identity information. In the situation like Covid‐19 pandemic, it becomes the top priority to quickly capture the physical occurrence of a certain personnel, in order to figure out the possible spreading trace and connections. However, the current recording system for office building management still has multiple shortcomings, including but not limited to low efficiency, low utilization for information, and low technology(through scanning health code and artificial recognition). This causes the weakness of supervision of external person and eventually unables to grasp personnel information detailedly.

We hope to improve current situation through completing this project to apply AI methods into traditional personnel recording system. This not only improve the efficiency of personnel management, but also improve the efficiency of tracking people related to the Covid-19. Because of  the universal property of the system, it may be applied more widely in the future in many other industries.
