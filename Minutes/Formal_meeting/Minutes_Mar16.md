#### Main topic

- Discussion on the content of the final report with supervisor, and had a deeper understanding of the key points of writing each section.

#### Progress made

- Completed all testing of the applet, both front-end and back-end.
- Unified front-end page style, making the whole page neat and beautiful.
- Implemented functions for workers to start and end tasks and upload images.
- Refactoring the code to make it structured and easy to read.

#### Problem met

- No idea of how to package code into a ready-to-run program, which means the program could only run in specific environment, and not ready for public release.
- In the process of refactoring the code, some of the original functionality was inadvertently modified resulting in an increased workload.
